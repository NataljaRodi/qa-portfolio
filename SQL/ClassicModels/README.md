# ClassicModels SQL Practice

## Overview

This project contains SQL queries written using the ClassicModels sample database as part of my QA Engineer training.

The goal of this practice was to develop the ability to retrieve, filter, and validate data directly from a relational database — a key skill in QA and database testing.

---

## What I practiced

* Retrieving data using `SELECT`
* Filtering results using `WHERE`
* Sorting data using `ORDER BY`
* Counting records using `COUNT`
* Finding specific records based on conditions

---

## Database

**ClassicModels** is a sample business database that includes realistic company data such as:

* customers
* employees
* products
* payments

This database is commonly used for learning SQL and practicing database queries.

---

## Project files

* `basic_queries.sql` – contains SQL queries created during practice

---

## Progress

Basic SQL queries completed.
Currently expanding skills with **JOIN queries** and more advanced SQL concepts.
