# QA Engineer portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository, created to showcase my skills and experience as a Junior QA Engineer.
This repository contains examples of my work from QA courses, internship, and self-practice, including test cases, bug reports, API testing, and basic SQL.
It reflects my approach to manual testing, attention to detail, and understanding of QA fundamentals.

I am continuously improving my skills and gradually expanding this portfolio as I learn new tools and techniques.

## About me
I am a Junior QA Engineer and a career changer, currently building my career in software testing. I came to QA after working in a different field and found that testing suits me because it combines analytical thinking, structure, and practical problem-solving.
I have completed QA courses and an internship, where I worked with manual testing of web and mobile applications. In my practice, I create test cases and checklists, write bug reports, perform basic API testing, and use basic SQL queries to work with test data.
I also have experience with freelance and crowdtesting tasks, where I tested real products, followed test scenarios, and reported issues according to given requirements.
At the moment, my main focus is on manual testing and gaining hands-on experience.
I am also starting to learn test automation and have an interest in AI-related topics.

👉 [Mobile Application Checklist](Examples-of-My-Work/Checklists/mobile_app_checklist.md)

### Test Cases

This section contains selected test cases created during my QA training and practice.
They demonstrate my ability to design structured test scenarios, define preconditions,
execute validation steps, and verify expected results.
