# QA Engineer portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository, created to showcase my skills and experience as a Junior QA Engineer.
This repository contains examples of my work from QA courses, internship, and self-practice, including test cases, bug reports, API testing, and basic SQL.
It reflects my approach to manual testing, attention to detail, and understanding of QA fundamentals.

I am continuously improving my skills and gradually expanding this portfolio as I learn new tools and techniques.

## About me
I am a Junior QA Engineer and a career changer, currently building my career in software testing. I came to QA after working in a different field and found that testing suits me because it combines analytical thinking, structure, and practical problem-solving.
I have completed QA courses and an internship, where I worked with manual testing of web and mobile applications. In my practice, I create test cases and checklists, write bug reports, perform basic API testing, and use basic SQL queries to work with test data.
I also have experience with freelance and crowdtesting tasks, where I tested real products, followed test scenarios, and reported issues according to given requirements.
At the moment, my main focus is on manual testing and gaining hands-on experience.
I am also starting to learn test automation and have an interest in AI-related topics.
